# CSharpExtendedCommands
A CSharp library project that started only to make few tasks easier but it started to become very big and it needed a name

Is this class anything can be added that would help in the development of CSharp projects in general.
In the class the are some class included that i decompiled and directly included in it. I did this for the following reason:
Take an example - The class SimpleJSON from NuGet. A very usefull library but if you want to hide the dll from the final project folder/distribution
you don't need to loaded directly from the resources it's already included in this library that can be directly added as a source file.

The main goal of this class is to just drag the CSharpExtendedCommands.cs source file into a project and be able to do many things simply.

Things such as: Grabbing computer info, solving math problems, some internet stuff, etc...


NOTE:
I started this class 3 years ago, a bit later after i started to learn programming in C#. Some parts of the code may be more optimized
and some very messy. And i there may be 1 or 2 classes that are somewhat useless.
