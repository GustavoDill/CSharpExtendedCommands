# CSharpExtendedCommands
The main goal of this library is to make many things simple with just 1 .cs file

A CSharp library project that started only to make few tasks easier but it started to become very big and it needed a name

In this class anything can be added that would help in the development of CSharp projects in general. In the class the are some class included that i decompiled and directly included in it. I did this for the following reason: Lazyness of adding libraries :)

Take an example - The class SimpleJSON from NuGet. A very usefull library but if you want to use it and hide the dll from the final project, you don't need to load it  from the resources and do all that stuff. Just add the CSharpExtendedCommands.cs and it's already included in this library! Just use it.

Things such as: Grabbing computer info, solving math problems, some internet stuff, etc...

NOTE: I started this class 3 years ago, a bit later after i started to learn programming in C#. The code might be good here and bad there and some stuff might be useless.
